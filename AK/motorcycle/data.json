          "answerC": "About 50 percent",
          "answerD": "About 70 percent",

          "answerC": "In the right portion of the lane.",
          "answerD": "On the shoulder. ",
          "explanation": "When being passed, the center portion of the lane is generally the safest lane position for a motorcyclist. Riding on the side nearest the passing vehicle increases the risk of colliding with it. Riding on the side farthest from the passing vehicle can also be dangerous because it may prompt the driver to return to your lane before it is safe to do so.",

          "answerD": "Instruct the passenger after you begin your trip.",
          "explanation": "You should transport a passenger only if your motorcycle is appropriately equipped and adjusted to do so. Among other things, your motorcycle should have separate footrests for the passenger and a seat that is large enough for more than one person to sit comfortably. You may need to adjust your headlight, tire pressure, and suspension to accommodate the extra weight of a passenger.",
