          "answerD": "Warn you when your brake pad needs replacing.",
          "explanation": "Some motorcycles are equipped with an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS). ABS is designed to prevent skidding and wheel lock-up when motorcyclists are stopping in straight-line, panic situations. ABS operates when maximum pressure is applied to both the front and rear brake controls. If electronic sensors detect the possibility of a wheel lock, brake hydraulic pressure is released then re-applied to maintain maximum braking effectiveness.",
