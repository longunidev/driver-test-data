          "explanation": "A properly chosen lane position can optimize a number of safety factors. Your lane position should keep you out of other vehicles’ blind spots, increase your ability to see and be seen, help you avoid surface hazards, help you avoid wind blasts from other vehicles, and provide you with an escape route from any hazards that might arise. You should be positioned in a way that discourages other drivers from trying to share your lane.",
