          "answerC": "Ride a little more slowly than usual.",
          "answerD": "Ride a little faster than usual.",
          "explanation": "Your motorcycle will sit lower than normal under the additional weight of a passenger. To accommodate, you should ride a bit more slowly than usual, particularly when riding through curves, through corners, or over bumps. The extra weight also means that your motorcycle will take longer than usual to speed up, slow down, or stop, so you should maintain a larger space cushion when carrying a passenger.",
