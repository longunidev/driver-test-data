          "answerD": "Honk at the bicyclist to let him or her know you are about to pass.",
          "explanation": "You should pass a bicyclist the same way you would pass any other vehicle, but not so fast or close to them that you throw debris in their face or blow them around with the draft of air from your vehicle. Allow at least 3 feet of space between your side mirror and the bicyclist, or at least 5 feet on higher speed roads or when there is a group of bicyclists. Honking unnecessarily may startle riders and make them more likely to crash.",

If the other driver does not move over, try to escape to the right. If you swerve left and the other driver corrects at the last instant, you will still crash.
