          "answerC": "Start slowing later than usual.",
          "answerD": "Try to squeeze into smaller gaps in traffic.",
          "explanation": "The added weight of a passenger will affect the handling of your motorcycle. Expect your motorcycle to accelerate more slowly than usual, turn more slowly than usual, and require extra space to come to a complete stop. Ride more slowly, start slowing sooner when approaching a stop, open up a larger space cushion, and wait for larger gaps when crossing, entering, or merging into traffic.",

Because the strip is usually no more than two feet wide, it is often possible to ride to one side of the strip and still be in the center portion of the lane.",

Your lane position should discourage other drivers from trying to share your lane and provide you with an escape route, should a hazard arise.
